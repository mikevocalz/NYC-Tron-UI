# Component inventory and ownership

The **source owner** for every reusable generic or professional Forge control is
`NYC-Tron-UI/packages/ui/src/components/`. Nitro Forge owns document engines,
complex editor screen composition and its cross-engine suite application.

**Important:** An npm import subpath chooses one entry point, not an independent
npm installation. Avoid grouping heavy optional native backends into a single
JS entry. Once package sizes are measurable, release separate optional packages
per native capability if necessary. All components still have ONE source owner
in NYC-Tron UI.

Use `unstyled` with a complete app-authored Tailwind recipe when the desired
visual style conflicts with the library's default recipe. This keeps Moyo's
neubrutalist strokes/shadows distinct from NYC-MON's cut-corner look and from
Forge's professional dark editor controls.

### Responsive table split

`@nyc-tron/ui/components/data/DataTable` is a TanStack Table v9 native
record list: it renders mobile label/value cards inside narrow panes and
full columns in wide ones.

`@nyc-tron/ui/components/forge/SpreadsheetGrid` is a **true**
editable coordinate sheet: on mobile it retains rows/column headers and
horizontal scrolling, stacks the formula bar, and expands touch targets.
It receives data from the separate Tally Rust engine, not from a fake
TanStack document engine.

Read [Responsive tables](RESPONSIVE_TABLES.md) for limitations and mobile
acceptance gates.

## Forge package choices

```text
Image:         @nitro-forge/prism     + /forge/* graphics controls you need
Audio:         @nitro-forge/cadence   + /forge/WaveformLane etc.
Video:         @nitro-forge/splice    + /forge/NativeSeekBar etc.
Documents:     @nitro-forge/quill     + /forge/document/* controls
Spreadsheets:  @nitro-forge/tally     + /forge/spreadsheet/* controls
Slides:        @nitro-forge/pitch     + /forge/slides/* controls
PDF:           @nitro-forge/folio     + /forge/pdf/* controls
All editors:   the consumer installs the above packages; there is no new
               monolithic native engine dependency inside NYC-Tron UI.
```

Some of these package names currently exist only on Nitro Forge draft PRs.
Do not claim npm availability or cross-platform native completion until
their respective distributions and PRs pass.

## 2026-11-04 advanced controls

PR #2 adds source-level prototype controls: InstrumentKnob/InstrumentXYPad, TreeGrid, PatchGraph, ImageCropOverlay and CommandPopover. All source resides in NYC-Tron (not Forge). See [the advanced native catalog](ADVANCED_NATIVE_COMPONENTS.md) and @nyc-tron/core/advanced-catalog for complete planned ports and review gates. Native OS adapters, device QA and source licenses are **not** completed by this extraction.

## 2026-11-05 PrecisionScrubber and DragGrabHandle

Both controls are controlled: the app passes the committed value (scrubber) or owns
the dragged item's position (handle), and each completed gesture produces one
`onCommit`. Neither control holds engine or document state.

Gesture recognition is injected through the `transport` prop. The default,
`PanResponderDrag`, needs no extra dependency. Native apps that mount
`GestureHandlerRootView` can pass `GestureHandlerDrag` instead. It is a separate
subpath, so `react-native-gesture-handler` stays an optional peer and is never
loaded by the scrubber or handle entry points. It uses the RNGH 3 `Gesture`
builder, which RNGH 3 marks deprecated in favour of `usePanGesture` /
`useTapGesture`; it matches the Forge source this was extracted from and should
move to the hook API together with Forge.

`PanResponderDrag` refuses responder termination requests once a drag is
granted. The Forge source allowed them, and in the browser run a parent
`ScrollView` then took the responder on vertical travel, so the fine/coarse
gesture never registered. The OS can still terminate the drag, which cancels it.

On web the forced-colors scale uses `var(--nyc-tron-canvas-text, CanvasText)`
and `var(--nyc-tron-highlight, Highlight)`: React Native Web drops bare system
color keywords. The handle's grip bars are top borders so forced colors keeps
them visible without a prop.

The forced-colors flag is a prop (`forcedColors`), since detecting it is the app's
job. The handle's default glyph is three bars drawn with views; pass `children` to
use an app icon.

## 2026-11-05 HSV picker

`HsvPicker` moved from Nitro Forge PR #34 (`NativeHsvPicker`) into
`packages/ui/src/components/forge/color/`. It is controlled: `value` and
`onValueChange` carry one `HsvColor`, `onApply` and `onCancel` let the Forge
host open and close its own undo transaction, and the picker keeps no color
state. `parseHexColor`, `rgbToHsv`, `hsvToRgb`, `assertHsv` and `wrapHue`
were added to the existing `/forge/color` module, which `ColorChannels` also
imports; there is no second copy of the math.

Screen readers adjust saturation with swipe up/down and reach brightness and
hue through named actions. Saturation and brightness also have 44pt
steppers. The picker has no animation. Consumers that import this subpath
must install `@expo/ui` and `expo-linear-gradient`; other subpaths do not
need them.

Labels (hue, hex, RGBA channels) are app-token RN `Text`; the `@expo/ui`
hosts carry only the sliders. `@expo/ui` Text follows the OS appearance, so
with a dark app theme on a light-mode device it drew black labels on the
dark surface. The universal `@expo/ui` Slider takes no accessible label, so
the hue slider is unnamed; the field's named hue actions are the labeled
path. An opacity-only channel edit keeps h/s/v exactly (`rgbaEditToHsv`).

Verified: source, types, unit tests, package exports, and a
react-native-web render in Chromium with the real `@expo/ui` and
`expo-linear-gradient` web builds (phone and tablet widths, light and dark,
and app theme opposite to the OS scheme). Synthesized touch drags on the
field kept the page from scrolling. Not verified: iOS, Android or foldable
device runs, and VoiceOver/TalkBack output.

### Ink toolbar and the Forge board

`InkToolbar` mirrors the board's tool model as of 2026-11-05. The ink lab
session (`apps/board-native-lab/InkLabSession.ts`) has three tools, `pen`,
`highlighter` and a stroke `eraser`, and counts undo and redo steps. The
QuickDraw scene compiler (`packages/board/src/skia/scene.ts`) uses the sizes
`s`/`m`/`l`/`xl` (2.5, 4, 6.5 and 10 points) and draws highlighter strokes 4.5
times wider. `INK_BOARD_TOOLS` and `INK_SIZE_POINTS` copy those values.

Decisions, recorded so the next change does not redo them:

- **BUILD** `marker` and `lasso` exist in the `InkTool` union but not in
  `INK_BOARD_TOOLS`. The board implements neither, so Forge must not list them
  until it does.
- **STRIKE** a tilt toggle. No branch reads tilt, altitude or azimuth, and
  `spatial-ink` reports pressure only. It returns when a board consumes tilt.
- **DEFER** a palm-rejection picker. The board's pointer router already has
  `palmRejection: "off" | "during-pen" | "after-pen"`; it needs a product call on
  whether users choose it or the host fixes it per device.
- **Pressure** renders only when the host passes `pressure`. Forge passes it
  when its pointer router has seen a measured pressure sample or pen-connect
  reaches `ready`; a `linked` Bluetooth pen is not enough.
- **Color** swatches come from the host (QuickDraw's named colors). NYC-Tron
  ships no palette. `onRequestCustomColor` asks the host to open
  `HsvPicker` (or `ColorChannels`) in its own popover. The toolbar does not
  embed the picker, so importing it never pulls in `@expo/ui` or
  `expo-linear-gradient`.
- **Icons** are a host slot (`icons`); text labels show until the planned
  `components/icons/` glyphs land.
- **Disabled controls** stay pressable and put their reason in a polite live
  line. React Native Web's `Pressable` overwrites `aria-disabled` and blocks the
  press, so the accessible name also carries ", unavailable".
- **Placement** is the host's call: pass `orientation="vertical"` and
  `edge="right"` for the physical-right rail on foldables and tablets (also in
  RTL), and a horizontal bar on phones.
