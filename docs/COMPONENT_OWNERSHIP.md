# Component inventory and ownership

The **source owner** for every reusable generic or professional Forge control is
`NYC-Tron-UI/packages/ui/src/components/`. Nitro Forge owns document engines,
complex editor screen composition and its cross-engine suite application.

**Important:** An npm import subpath chooses one entry point, not an independent
npm installation. Avoid grouping heavy optional native backends into a single
JS entry. Once package sizes are measurable, release separate optional packages
per native capability if necessary. All components still have ONE source owner
in NYC-Tron UI.

Use `unstyled` with a complete app-authored Tailwind recipe when the desired
visual style conflicts with the library's default recipe. This keeps Moyo's
neubrutalist strokes/shadows distinct from NYC-MON's cut-corner look and from
Forge's professional dark editor controls.

### Responsive table split

`@nyc-tron/ui/components/data/DataTable` is a TanStack Table v9 native
record list: it renders mobile label/value cards inside narrow panes and
full columns in wide ones.

`@nyc-tron/ui/components/forge/SpreadsheetGrid` is a **true**
editable coordinate sheet: on mobile it retains rows/column headers and
horizontal scrolling, stacks the formula bar, and expands touch targets.
It receives data from the separate Tally Rust engine, not from a fake
TanStack document engine.

Read [Responsive tables](RESPONSIVE_TABLES.md) for limitations and mobile
acceptance gates.

## Forge package choices

```text
Image:         @nitro-forge/prism     + /forge/* graphics controls you need
Audio:         @nitro-forge/cadence   + /forge/WaveformLane etc.
Video:         @nitro-forge/splice    + /forge/NativeSeekBar etc.
Documents:     @nitro-forge/quill     + /forge/document/* controls
Spreadsheets:  @nitro-forge/tally     + /forge/spreadsheet/* controls
Slides:        @nitro-forge/pitch     + /forge/slides/* controls
PDF:           @nitro-forge/folio     + /forge/pdf/* controls
All editors:   the consumer installs the above packages; there is no new
               monolithic native engine dependency inside NYC-Tron UI.
```

Some of these package names currently exist only on Nitro Forge draft PRs.
Do not claim npm availability or cross-platform native completion until
their respective distributions and PRs pass.

## 2026-11-04 advanced controls

PR #2 adds source-level prototype controls: InstrumentKnob/InstrumentXYPad, TreeGrid, PatchGraph, ImageCropOverlay and CommandPopover. All source resides in NYC-Tron (not Forge). See [the advanced native catalog](ADVANCED_NATIVE_COMPONENTS.md) and @nyc-tron/core/advanced-catalog for complete planned ports and review gates. Native OS adapters, device QA and source licenses are **not** completed by this extraction.

## 2026-11-05 PrecisionScrubber and DragGrabHandle

Both controls are controlled: the app passes the committed value (scrubber) or owns
the dragged item's position (handle), and each completed gesture produces one
`onCommit`. Neither control holds engine or document state.

Gesture recognition is injected through the `transport` prop. The default,
`PanResponderDrag`, needs no extra dependency. Native apps that mount
`GestureHandlerRootView` can pass `GestureHandlerDrag` instead. It is a separate
subpath, so `react-native-gesture-handler` stays an optional peer and is never
loaded by the scrubber or handle entry points. It uses the RNGH 3 `Gesture`
builder, which RNGH 3 marks deprecated in favour of `usePanGesture` /
`useTapGesture`; it matches the Forge source this was extracted from and should
move to the hook API together with Forge.

`PanResponderDrag` refuses responder termination requests once a drag is
granted. The Forge source allowed them, and in the browser run a parent
`ScrollView` then took the responder on vertical travel, so the fine/coarse
gesture never registered. The OS can still terminate the drag, which cancels it.

On web the forced-colors scale uses `var(--nyc-tron-canvas-text, CanvasText)`
and `var(--nyc-tron-highlight, Highlight)`: React Native Web drops bare system
color keywords. The handle's grip bars are top borders so forced colors keeps
them visible without a prop.

The forced-colors flag is a prop (`forcedColors`), since detecting it is the app's
job. The handle's default glyph is three bars drawn with views; pass `children` to
use an app icon.

## 2026-11-05 studio content and feedback primitives (part B)

Nitro Forge's studio host took these from NYC-MON's `@acme/ui`. They are now
NYC-Tron components; part A (Select, SegmentedControl, TabBar, Toolbar, List,
IconButton, FieldGroup) is a separate change.

### Forge slot map

| Forge slot or import | NYC-Tron import |
| --- | --- |
| `StudioUIComponents.Banner` | `Banner` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/feedback/Banner` |
| `StudioUIComponents.Badge` | `Badge` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/feedback/Badge` |
| `StudioUIComponents.EmptyState` | `EmptyState` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/feedback/EmptyState` |
| `StudioUIComponents.ErrorMessage` | `ErrorMessage` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/feedback/ErrorMessage` |
| `StudioUIComponents.KeyValueList` | `KeyValueList` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/content/KeyValueList` |
| `StudioUIComponents.NightScope` | `NightScope` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/theme/NightScope` |
| `StudioUIComponents.DropZone` | `DropZone` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/files/DropZone` |
| `@acme/ui/studio-controls/web` `FilePicker` | `FilePicker` from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/files/FilePicker` |
| `@acme/ui/html` `Page`, `Main`, `Header`, `Footer`, `Section`, `Nav`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Paragraph`, `Link`, `Input` | same names from `@nyc-tron/ui/components/html` |

`packages/ui/tests/forge-slots.typecheck.tsx` copies Forge's slot prop types
and assigns each component to its slot, so `pnpm typecheck` fails if a
component stops accepting what Forge passes.

Props Forge passes that no longer pick colors: `EmptyState` `tone`
(`royal`/`carolina`) and `KeyValueList`/`ErrorMessage` `surface`. They are
accepted so call sites compile; colors come from the app's tokens and the
nearest `NightScope`. Forge's studio preview clears the DropZone well with
`className="border-0 p-0 ..."`; pass `unstyled` instead, since two
conflicting utilities resolve by stylesheet order, not by their order in the
string.

### Decisions

- **Semantic set on web (BUILD).** React Native Web's `unstable_createElement`
  emits `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<h2>`, `<a>` with RN style and aria
  handling. A View with `role` reaches most of these elements too but always
  writes the role attribute, so a header nested in a section would announce a
  second page banner. The elements get RN View's flex-column defaults;
  text elements default to `dir="auto"` like RNW Text and inherit the page font.
- **Native semantic set (BUILD).** View/Text with the ARIA `role` prop, never
  `accessibilityRole`, whose Android enum throws on landmark roles. Landmarks
  are silent to VoiceOver and TalkBack. A native `Link` opens only absolute
  `http(s):`, `mailto:` and `tel:` hrefs; an app-router path needs `onPress`,
  and without it the link renders as plain text, not a link that does nothing.
- **FilePicker on native (DEFER).** The contract hands the app `File`
  objects, which React Native does not have, and the kit has no
  document-picker peer. A native adapter returning URIs would be a different
  contract and lands as its own subpath. Until then native FilePicker renders
  nothing, and native apps take files through DropZone or their own picker.
- **DropZone web without expo-drag-drop-content-view (BUILD).** Its 0.9.2 web
  bundle ships JSX in a `.js` file that Vite/Rolldown parse as JavaScript. The
  web fork attaches `dragenter`/`dragover`/`dragleave`/`drop` listeners to the
  view's DOM node and keeps the package's `DropAsset` shape.
- **NightScope (BUILD).** Delegates to Uniwind's `ScopedTheme`, which on web
  renders a `display: contents` element with the theme class and on native
  resolves the theme's variables. The app's theme CSS must scope that class.
- **Status tones (BUILD).** `info` and `success` join `TronTheme` as optional
  tokens; see THEME_TOKENS.md.
- **Marks drawn with views.** Banner, ErrorMessage and Badge marks are views
  with borders, so forced colors keeps them; pass `icon` to Banner for the
  app's icon set.

### Verified, and not

Chromium through React Native Web (`packages/ui/tests/browser`,
`primitives.spec.mjs`): semantic elements and attributes, live regions, 44pt
dismiss, keyboard dismiss, accept filtering on drop, one enter per drag, the
file chooser path, NightScope colors on a light page, KeyValueList columns at
390 and 834 px, RTL, plus light/dark, focus, drag-over and forced-colors
captures. Not run: iOS/Android rendering, expo-drag-drop-content-view drops on
a device, Uniwind's native ScopedTheme, screen readers, Safari and Firefox.
